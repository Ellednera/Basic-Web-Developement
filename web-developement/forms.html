<h1>Forms</h1>
<p>
Forms are used to collect user input. To create forms in HTML, the &lt;form&gt;&lt;/form&gt; tag
is used. There are 3 attributes used in the form tag. They are the action, method and enctype attribute.
</p>
<p>
The action attribute tells the browser where to take the user after the user submit the form. This 
attribute also tells the browser where to process the data of a form. The value for the action attribute 
is a path of a destination.It can be an URL of just a path. You will learn how the data is processed in PHP.
</p>
<p>
The method attribute specifies whether of not the data should be present in the URL after the user submit 
his/her data. There are only 2 values for the method attribute--post and get. <br>
When method="get", all the data will show in the URL and all of them will be processed on the web page the 
action attribute specifies. <br>
When method="post", all the data will be sent to the server to be processed and no data will be shown in the 
URL. This is very useful when you are going to process sensitive data for example passwords, e-mail, handphone 
number etc.
</p>
<p>
The enctype attribute tells the server how the data of the form should be encoded. Another way of saying is what type of 
data is present in the form and how should they be processed. The most commom value is "multipart/form-data" and this 
will let the broswer know that there is a file upload. Using enctype="multipart/form-data" in a form which has no 
file uploads will not cause any errors.
</p>

<h3>User Inputs</h3>
<p>
To create a user input(text box), use the &lt;input&gt; tag. The input tag is an empty element so it has no closing tag.
Inside the input tag is usually these 3 attribute-- type, name and value.<br><br>
<span id="cont">To be continued...<br>
Sorry, there are too many things for this topic.
</span>
</p>

<h3>Data Processing</h3>
<p>
Whenever someone fills a HTML form and click the submit button, the form data will be passed to either the URL or to the 
server.
The HTML &lt;form&gt;  tag has an attribute named "method" to specify where we want the data to go. There are 2 types of actions,
"GET" and "POST" (case sensitive, beware). "GET" will send the data into the URL directly and the data is visible to the user. This
method of sending data is not safe at all (with exceptions, of course). Usually, we send the data to the server through "POST" so that
no one can see the data except the programmer, the programmer's program and the server itself, sometimes a good hacker too :)
</p>

<h3>Languages Used for Data Processing</h3>
<p>
The most common language used is PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor, it used to be <b>P</b>ersonal <b>H</b>ome <b>P</b>age). To run PHP, what 
we usually do is to download a virtual server (XAMPP if you're using Windows). XAMPP supports several languages specifically for web 
programming--PHP, SQL (with a database called MariaDB or MySQL) and Perl for CGI programming. Perl used to be king of all the languages 
during the 2000 period. It's still alive and it's awesome!
</p>

<dl>
	<dt>PHP</dt>
		<dd>This is the most common language used to interact with the form data. PHP is a programming language.</dd>
	<dt>SQL</dt>
		<dd>
			"Structured Query Language" is used to interact with the database(DB). After processing data from a form, these data can be stored 
			into the server, we call it the database. SQL can be embeded with PHP through the functions starting with "mysql_*" or "mysqli_*"
			"mysqli_*" is more secure.
		</dd>
	<dt>Perl</dt>
		<dd>
			Perl is....yes, just Perl :) Actually, its full name is "Practical Extraction and Report", but Perl is not a acronynm. The word "Perl" 
			was chosen and the the gaps were filled in later, very different than the languages out there. It was supposed to be named "Pearl", but 
			another language with this name existed back then, so we ended up with Perl. Perl was meant to replace the C language (it was also written using C)
			, but that didn't happen. In web porogramming, Perl can be used to write (generate) HTML web pages, process data and interact with the database. 
			The best part of Perl is that it can control how the server should treat the webpage(in simple words--to display or not to display the web page).
			Perl can also be used as a stand-alone programming language. Its grammar is strange but powerful. Perl ressembels maths a lot. Perl makes more sense 
			compared to other languages. Perl's logic is like maths logic, everything derived must have a source. This is not true with other languages because 
			their creator just invent it in a way they liked it. Based on my understanding, Perl is HTML+CSS+PHP+SQL, pretty cool, huh?
		</dd>
	<dt>Ruby</dt>
		<dd>
			Ruby itself can be used to do web programming too. But, its not "pure" Ruby. Ruby has a framework(or library or whatever its called) to do this job--Ruby on Rails.
			This language seems to be dying out especially when it comes to web programming. Plus, Ruby iteslf is slow.
		</dd>
	<dt>Javascript</dt>
		<dd>
			Javascript is usually used to do front-end stuff, like HTML and CSS. However, there's a library out there called Node.js which claim to be able to interact with databases.
			You might want to check it out yourself, I don't know much about Javascript stuff, sorry.
