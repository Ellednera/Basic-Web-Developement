Baruch Hashem, this local webpage was updated after so many years!
The form.html was updated, but there's still no extra stuff in the forms part :)

THANK YOU FOR SPENDING TIME TO READ THIS

To start the lesson, click on the file "index.html" and you will see a home page opened in your web 
broswer. 

Due to insufficient time, I only wrote brief notes and most of them are incomplete. So, in order to 
understand better certain topics, you'll need to go to http://www.w3schools.com or just click the link 
at the bottom of the home page.

I'm planning to put these offline web pages online and I'll only be able to do it during the long term 
holidays. Until then, all the topics will be ready, hopefully.

I will notify you about the online notes when they are ready.

Thank you.

Your friend,
Raphael Jong Jun Jie
