<h1>Hyperlinks and Images</h1>

<h2><u>Hyperlinks</u></h2>
<p>
Hyperlinks, also known as links, are used to link/bring the users on a web page to another web page. By default, 
hyperlinked texts are blue in colour before it is cliked. Once clicked, it will turn to purple colour. The clicked 
links will remain purple until you clear your search history in the web broswer. The hyperlinked text will turn red 
if the hyperlinked text is active. Below is an example of a hyperlink.
</p>
<p id="back-white">
Go to <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>.
</p>

<h3><u>Attributes for Hyperlink Tag</u></h3>
<p>
In the hyperlink tag, there are 2 attributes that are:</br>
1. href="<i>value</i>"<br>
2. target="<i>value</i>"
</p>


<h3><u>How to Use the Hyperlink Tag</u></h3>
<p>
This is how a hyperlink which brings the user to http://www.google.com is written.
</p>
<p>
&lt;p&gt;<br>
Go to &lt;a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank"&gt;Google
&lt;/a&gt;<br>
&lt;/p&gt;
</p>
<p>
1. &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the hyperlink tag. <br>
2. The <b>href</b> attribute tells the web browser where to go after the hyperlinked text is clicked. <br>
3. The <b>target</b> attribute tells the web browser how and where to display the web page which is linked to.
</p>
<p>
NOTES<br>
1. The value for the <b>href</b> attribute is either a file destination or a website. For websites, the 
value must have "http://" or else the web browser will think that it is a file destination and searches 
for the file in your directory. To link to another web page in a file in the same directory, declare the 
filename <b>TOGETHER WITH ITS EXTENSION</b>. To link to a web page inside of a different directory, declare
the name of the directory and put a forward slash(<b>/</b>) until you reach the file you want to link to. <br><br>
2. The easiest value to use in the <b>target</b> attribute is <b>_blank</b>, this will display the linked web 
page in a new tab. If you want the linked web page to display in the original web page, there is no need to use 
the <b>target</b> attribute.
</p>

<h2><u>Images</u></h2>
<p>
In a web page, you can also insert images by using the image tag, &lt;img&gt;. An image tag is an empty element and 
doesn't need to be closed. 
</p>
<p>
When inserting an image, you might want to resize or declare the size of your image. This can be done by using the 
<b>width</b> and <b>height</b> attributes. The values of these two attributes are numbers, e.g. height="300". The
web broswer will reconise the number as the number of pixels.
</p>
<p>
If you would like to changes the size of an image but maintain its shape, this is when Mathematics comes in. You will need
to calculate the size of the image using ratio. Below is the formula: <br>
<pre>
Let original width=x<sub>o</sub>
Let original height=y<sub>o</sub>
Let new width=x<sub>n</sub>
Let new height=y<sub>n</sub>

x<sub>o</sub>/y<sub>o</sub> = x<sub>n</sub>/y<sub>n</sub>
</pre>
</p>
<p>
If your final answer is a double(number with decimals) like 367.39, just round it off to the nearest integer. One pixel is no 
big deal as a pixel is very small in size(smaller than 1mm).
