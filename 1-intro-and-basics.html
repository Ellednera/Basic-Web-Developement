<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
HTML is the short form for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is not a programming language, it is only a 
markup language which tell the web browser how to present your data. HTML is the fundamental language for 
building/creating web pages. The current version of HTML is version 5(HTML5) which we are using.
</p>
<p>
Website/Web page was created by Sir Tim Bernes-Lee(Sir Timothy John Bernes-Lee). Before web pages exists, 
scientists needed to log in to different computers to retrieve certain data becuase most of the data was 
stored in different computers. This is why Sir Tim Bernes-Lee created web pages. With a web page, all 
the data can be stored in one place and can be retrieved easily through the Internet.
</p>
<p>
All languages for building web pages, for example HTML and CSS are controlled by the World Wide Web Consortium 
(W3C) in order to provide standard universal languages.
</p>
<p>
Markup languages consist of YAML, XML, HTML, CSS and XHTML while programming languages used for building web pages
include Javascript(not to be confused with Java), PHP, SQL, JQuery, Perl, Ruby and SASS.
</p>
<p>
Before we start with HTML, there are some important things to take note of.
<ul>
<li>
You will need a better text editor like Notepad++. However, the built-in text editor in Windows operating systems 
can still be used. The advantages of using Notepad++ is that it has syntax-highlighting features to ease your job.
</li>
<li>
Whenever you save a new file, a pop-up box will appear asking for the destination of the file you want to save. This 
box is called a dialoge box.
</li>
<li>
There are 2 extensions for HTML files, .htm(for very old Windows systems which only supports 3 characters for 
extensions) and .html
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Let's Begin</h1>
<p>
Every HTML file starts with a declaration of the document type at the very first line. The declaration in a HTML file 
tells the web broswer what version of HTML we are using. In HTML version 5, the declaration is very simple, just type 
in &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; and the browser will know that we are using HTML5.
</p>
<p>
After declaring the document type here comes the html tag,&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;. All the contents of your web page 
goes 
in here.
</p>
<p>
Inside the html tag, there are two important elements(tags), the head tag,&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; and the body tag, 
&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;.
</p>
<p>
The head tag functions as the brain for your web page while the body tag comsists of all the data you want to print on 
the screen.
</p>
<p>
For beginners, you will only use the title tag,&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt; inside of the head tag. The title tag must go 
inside of the head tag. The title tag represents the title for your HTML file. It is also used in displaying the title of 
a website in search engines.
</p>
<p>
In HTML files, anything(except in the paragraph tag) with the word "title" will display a small box with the same text 
when you point your pointer to the text. Any text within the title tag will display the text at the tab of a page. Now, 
move your pointer to the tab and you will see how the title tag works.
</p>

<h1>Let's Print Some Text!</h1>
<p>
To print text, use the paragraph tag, &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;.
</p>
<p>
To make headings, use the heading tag, &lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;. <br>
In HTML, the size of the heading is limited, which is from h1 to h6 only. h1 prints a heading with the biggest text while 
h6 prints the smallest text for a heading. Below is a example for the paragraph tag and the heading tag.
</p>
<h3><u>The Paragraph Tag</u></h3>
<p>Hello world</p>

<h3><u>h1 to h6 Tags</u></h3>
<h1>Heading 1, h1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2, h2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3, h3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4, h4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5, h5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6, h6</h6>
