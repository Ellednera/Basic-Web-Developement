# Basic-Web-Developement
This is a guide to understanding and learning how to build webpages(super basic stuff).
This project can be considered as an incomplete and abandoned project :)

To start the lesson, click on the file "index.html" and you will see a home page opened in your web broswer.
All the links clicked will bring you to a new tab, so you'll always have the home page with you.
